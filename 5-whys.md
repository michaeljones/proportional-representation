The [5-Whys technique](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm) was created by the
Toyota car company as part of their manufacturing strategy to help them get the root cause of
problems and prevent them instead of fixing symptoms of the underlying problem.

If we apply this to our political system, we might get something like this.


## First Path

- **Initial Problem Statement**

  We have low participation and interest in politics & politicians.

- **Why aren't people interested in politics?**

  There doesn't seem to be much choice in the political spectrum. No matter who you vote for you
  get similar results.

- **Why do you end up with similar results?**

  The main parties' political viewpoints appear to be quite similar.

- **Why are the viewpoints of the parties quite similar?**

  If there are only two parties then the desire to appeal to the largest possible audience pushes
  them together so that each one alienates as few voters as possible from the other side.

- **Why are there only two main parties?**

  The UK's first-past-the-post system creates a winner takes all situation in which votes for less
  popular parties are essentially wasted and so people tend to only vote for the two main ones.

- **Why do we have a first-past-the-post system?**

  The UK moved to first-past-the-post in the 1880s. Previously it had an even less democratic system
  in place. Whilst other countries have moved to other more proportional systems the UK never has.


## Second Path

- **Initial Problem Statement**

  We have low participation and interest in politics & politicians.

- **Why aren't people interested in politics?**

  There doesn't seem to be much choice in the political spectrum. No matter who you vote for you
  get similar results.

- **Why doesn't your vote impact the results?**

  Under the UK's first-past-the-post system, a large number of votes are essentially wasted as they
  have no impact on the first result.

- **Why are a large number of votes wasted?**

  As the first-past-the-post system only rewards the candidate with the most votes, voting for a
  candidate that is popular but unlikely to win is essentially pointless.

  Each seat becomes either a safe seat, in which only one candidate is ever likely to win and all
  votes for other candidates are wasted, or a competition seat between two parties where all votes
  for any other candidate are wasted.

  Further to that, in a safe seat, any votes over the minimum threshold required to win are also
  wasted as a large turn out and support for a candidate does not result in any more representation
  than a minimum turnout.

- **Why is it a bad thing for the most popular candidate to win?**

  Obviously, we want the most popular candidate to be elected but the trouble comes when you think
  of everyone that doesn't feel like their views are represented by the candidate. They have no
  representation. A system where all votes contribute to the distribution of elected representatives
  from the different parties results in a more representative system.

  You might vote for a less popular party in your area but if the party receives other small amounts
  of support in other areas then all your separate interests and desire for representation add up
  and the party will have some candidates elected to office. In the first-past-the-post system the
  party would fail to come first in every area and have no representatives in office.

- **Why do we have a first-past-the-post system?**

  The UK moved to first-past-the-post in the 1880s. Previously it had an even less democratic system
  in place. Whilst other countries have moved to other more proportional systems the UK never has.
