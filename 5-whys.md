# 5 Whys

The [5-Whys technique](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm) was created by the
Toyota car company as part of their manufacturing strategy to help them get the root cause of
problems and prevent them instead of fixing symptoms of the underlying problem.

If we apply this to our political system, we might get something like this:

- **Initial Problem Statement**

  We have low participation and interest in politics & politicians.

- **Why aren't people interested in politics?**

  There doesn't seem to be much choice in the political spectrum. No matter who your vote for you
  get similar results.

- **Why do you end up with similar results?**

  The main parties' political view points appear to be quite similar.

- **Why are the view points of the parties quite similar?**

  If there are only two parties then the desire to appeal to the largest possible audience pushes
  them together so that each one alienates as few voters as possible from the other side.

- **Why are there only two parties?**

  Our first-past-the-post system creates a winner takes all system in which votes for less popular
  parties are essentially wasted votes and so people tend to only vote for the two main ones.

- **Why do we have a first-part-the-post system?**

  The UK moved to first-past-the-post in the 1880s. Previously it had an even less democratic system
  in place.
