There is a phenomenon in which given a one mile stretch of beach with two ice cream sellers, the ice
cream sellers will set up next to each other in the middle.

This is bad for the the beach goers who would be best served by having ice cream sellers evenly
spaced along the beach to minimise the distance to walk to get ice cream from any one point.

However with ice cream sellers at the best positions for the beach goers, which would be 25% and 75%
along the length of the beach, both sellers gain market share by moving towards the middle. This
results in both sellers ultimately setting up in the middle of the beach.

There are parallels with political systems that are dominated by two parties. Neither party is
incentivised to move away from the middle. Every step away from the middle risks leaving more of the
voting market to the other party.

But the further a voter has to 'walk' along the political spectrum to get to a party, the less
represented their viewpoint is. So in many ways voters would be better represented with parties
that are further apart along the political spectrum but the natural pressures of a two party system
push the parties together.

The trouble though is not that the two parties stay at the centre but rather that there are only two
parties in the system. The rule breaks down with more competition. A third ice cream seller in the
middle of the beach cannot reliably get as much trade as if they set up somewhere else along the
beach. So we want more ice cream sellers to better serve the beach goers. We want more parties to
better serve the voters.

In the UK, we have first-past-the-post voting which tends to result in two party systems.
Due to the winner takes all approach, voters in a first-past-the-post system will tend to only vote
for a party with a chance of winning. If they vote for their favoured but less popular party, their
vote is essentially wasted. This means it is almost impossible to introduce new parties with a
viable chance of winning into the system.

It would be like saying the beach is limited to two ice cream sellers and you can only be one of
those two sellers if you were one of the two top ice cream sellers the week before. Otherwise you
have to set up five blocks away from the beach on the edge of the town. The edge of town might have
a lot of ice cream sellers but no one is going to visit them and they'll never get a chance on the
beach.

So the solution is to change the rules, to allow more ice cream sellers on the beach and to give
more options to the beach goers so they don't have to walk so far to get an ice cream.

Voting systems that work around proportional representation provide this option in voting. You can
vote for whoever you like and you will be better represented by those that are finally elected.


## Notes

In real life, ice cream sellers have the option to differentiate themselves on price and the
products they offer. People will walk further and spend more if they value better quality ice cream
that only one seller sells.

In politics, eveyone has a single vote so the 'price' is fixed and no one has to physically walk
different distances to different parties. The policies the parties offer are the thing that
determines their place along the political spectrum.
